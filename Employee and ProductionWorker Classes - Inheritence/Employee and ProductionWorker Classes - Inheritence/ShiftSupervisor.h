/*
 ShiftSupervisor Class
 In a particular factory a shift supervisor is a salaried employee who supervises a shift. In addition to a salary, the shift supervisor earns a yearly bonus when his or her shift meets production goals. Design a ShiftSupervisor class that is derived from the Employee class you created in Programming Challenge 1. The ShiftSupervisor class should have a member variable that holds the annual salary and a member variable that holds the annual production bonus that a shift supervisor has earned. Write one or more constructors and the appropriate accessor and mutator functions for the class. Demonstrate the class by writing a program that uses a ShiftSupervisor object.

    //Default Constructor
    ShiftSupervisor () : ProductionWorker() {

        bonus = 3000;

    //Constructor
    ShiftSupervisor(string SSV_name, string SSV_employee_number, string SSV_hire_date, int SSV_shift, double SSV_hourly_pay_rate, double SSV_annual_salary, double SSV_bonus)
